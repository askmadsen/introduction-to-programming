# My Project Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! 👋  
This repository showcases the projects and coding exercises I have completed during my computer science degree, along with personal projects developed independently.  

The portfolio is organized by semester for academic work and by category for personal projects. Each project folder contains a README with a description, instructions for running the code, and any reports or notes.

## Academic Projects

### Semester 1 – Introduction to Programming
During my first semester, I focused on foundational programming concepts and exercises. While no full-scale projects were completed, these exercises demonstrate my grasp of various programming paradigms and coding fundamentals.

Mini-projects / exercises include:

- **[Recursive Programming](Academic/Semester_1/Recursive_Programming/README.md)** – Implemented recursive algorithms and practiced breaking problems into subproblems.  
- **[Functional Programming](Academic/Semester_1/Functional_Programming/README.md)** – Exercises using higher-order functions, map/filter/reduce, and pure functional principles.  
- **[Imperative Programming](Academic/Semester_1/Imperative_Programming/README.md)** – Code exercises using loops, conditionals, and step-by-step problem solving.  
- **[Data Classes](Academic/Semester_1/DataClasses/README.md)** – Practiced using Python dataclasses for clean, maintainable code and structured data.
- **[Small Projects](Academic/Semester_1/Small_Projects/README.md)** – Practiced implementing classic algorithms and numerical methods, including primes, integrals, root finding, and Pascal’s triangle.
